# 🌿 Environment Monitoring System 🌡️

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an **IoT-based Environmental Monitoring System** designed to monitor **temperature** and **humidity** in real-time. Using microcontrollers and sensors, it collects and sends environmental data to the cloud for remote access and visualization. 🌍📡

## ✨ Features
- 🌡️ Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- 📶 Wi-Fi enabled data transmission (ESP8266/ESP32)
- ☁️ Cloud storage integration (ThingSpeak, Firebase)
- 📱 Remote data access via web or mobile apps
- 🚨 Alerts or automated actions based on sensor data (optional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Hardware               | Software                     | Cloud & Frontend               |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Arduino UNO            | Arduino IDE                  | ThingSpeak / Firebase         |
| ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module   | DHT11 Sensor Library         | Web/Mobile App Visualization  |
| DHT11 Temperature Sensor| ESP8266WiFi Library          |                               |

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 🔌 Hardware Setup
1. Connect the **DHT11 sensor** to your microcontroller (Arduino/ESP8266). 🔧
2. Attach the **Wi-Fi module** for internet connectivity. 🌐
3. Power up the system and verify sensor readings. ⚡

### 💻 Software Setup
1. Install **Arduino IDE** and required libraries (`DHT sensor`, `ESP8266WiFi`). 📥
2. Enter your **Wi-Fi credentials** and **cloud API keys** in the Arduino sketch. 🔑
3. Upload the code to your microcontroller. 🚀

### ☁️ Cloud Setup
- Create an account on **ThingSpeak** or **Firebase**. 📝
- Set up your channel or database to receive sensor data. 📊
- Configure your device to send data to the cloud. 🔄

### 📊 Viewing Data
- Open your cloud dashboard to see live sensor data. 👀
- Use a mobile app for remote monitoring on the go. 📲

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
- Run the microcontroller with the uploaded code. ▶️
- Ensure a stable Wi-Fi connection. 📶
- Monitor environmental parameters anytime, anywhere! 🌍
